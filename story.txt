There was once a monkey and a crocodile.
The monkey lived in a tree full of ripe and luscious mango's.
The crocodiles wife wanted to eat the monkey because all his life he had been eating mangoes.
So the crocodiles wife thought that the monkey would taste good.
So she sent crocodile to trick the monkey into coming to their house.
The crocodile somehow convinced the monkey to come on his back,
to take him to  their house in the river to talk.
Midway the crocodile knew the monkey could not escape due to strong currents,
so he told the monkey his and his wife's true intentions.
The monkey knew he would have to trick the crocodile
