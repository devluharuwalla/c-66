There was once a monkey and a crocodile.
The monkey lived in a tree full of ripe and luscious mango's.
The crocodiles wife wanted to eat the monkey because all his life he had been eating mangoes.
So the crocodiles wife thought that the monkey would taste good.
So she sent crocodile to trick the monkey into coming to their house.
The crocodile somehow convinced the monkey to come on his back,
to take him to  their house in the river to talk.
Midway the crocodile knew the monkey could not escape due to strong currents,
so he told the monkey his and his wife's true intentions.
The monkey knew he would have to trick the crocodile into going back to land,
so he could flee from him.
the monkey then told the crocodile that since he didnt have any choice,
he would be eaten.
the monkey told the crocodile if his wife really wanted to enjoy eating him,
she would have to eat his heart.
The problem was that he left his heart on his tree.
He told the cocodile to take him back to the tree,
so he could get his heart.
the moment hte crocodile came near land,
the monkey fled and climbed up the tree.
